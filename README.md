# Multiview-Video-CODEC
Encodes and Decodes multiple views of uncompressed video of YUV format.

Recently several technologies have been under research in the field of multimedia. Free Viewpoint Video (FVV), Free Viewpoint television (FTV), 3DTV are some known applications. Among them the FVV is expected to provide a new visual experience, where user can visualize a scene or a thing from various different angles. All these technologies are addressed by one major technology MVC. 
A multi-view video is one which includes the capture of a scene from various cameras. MVC is used to compress the video captured from those various cameras. 

In recent year MPEG has addressed the needs for standardization in the area of 3D and free viewpoint video in a group called 3DAV. In depth approaches of MVC technologies were seemed to be promising enough to call for a new standard for multi-view video coding. 
MVC is developed for efficient coding of multi-view sequences. It unlike the simple video coding experiences two kinds of similarities, temporal similarities and inter-view similarities. 

Temporal similarities just like in any other video exist between different frames of the same view. However in case of multi-view video sequences, an additional similarity do exists which is the similarity between the two views of the same scene. These redundancies are removed by motion estimation and disparity compensation. The two techniques will be discussed in later chapters. 
An area of thought in the case of multi-view video sequences has always been its consumption of bandwidth. A multi-view video source can utilize much amount of bandwidth, however efficient coding in MVC has allowed it to overcome any bandwidth issues whatsoever. 
MVC has not only overcome the bandwidth issues but also has addressed the increasing significance of realistic video these days
